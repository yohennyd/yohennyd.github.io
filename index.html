      <h3>Why I like the show</h3>

      <p>I always watch Friends whenever I have a chance. Even though it first aired more than<br>
      20 years ago, they still put it on live TV. It is a comfort show. It's good to watch random<br>
      episode. It is those type of shows that you can watch over and over again and<br>
      not get bored.</p>

      <h3>Why you should watch it</h3>

      <p>It teaches the true meaning of friendships despite the harships and betrayals.<br>
      You can watch it whenever you want to smile, cry or laugh.<br>
      You learn how to forgive, get past things, adapt and accept others for who<br>
    are.</p>
